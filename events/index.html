To filter events, add the following to _config.yml:
  events_filter: YOUR_STRING_HERE

…it will be interpreted as a regular expression
(leave out the //i, as that's added automatically)
— but you can also just use a simple string too.

If you would like to not do a substring match on descriptions
(this is the default), but only show events that match tags,
also add the following to _config.yml:
  events_filter_tags_only: true

To have a calendar intro to the left of the calendar widget,
add Markdown as a string to calendar_intro in _config.yml, like so:
  calendar_intro: |
    This is the calendar info.

    You can have multiple paragraphs and
    [links too](https://example.com/)

Also, be sure to have the following SASS enabled in site.scss:
  @import 'lib/quicklinks';
  @import 'lib/events';

If, instead, you do not wish to have events, comment out the CSS above
and add the events page to the exclude: block in _config.yml, like so:
  exclude:
    - Gemfile
    - Gemfile.lock
    - (and so on)
    - events

{% include events.html blurb=site.calendar_intro %}
