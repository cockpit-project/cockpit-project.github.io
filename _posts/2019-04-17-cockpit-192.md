Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 192.

### Machines: Auto-detect guest operating system

When creating a new VM, the "OS Vendor" and "Operating System" fields are now
set automatically after specifying the installation sources for many vendors.
This uses the libvirt [osinfo-detect](https://libosinfo.org/) utility.

### Translation cleanup

Instead of showing just a predetermined set of languages, the language dialog
now offers all available translations, ordered alphabetically, in their native
translations:

Also, translations with less than 50% completion coverage got removed.

### Allow accounts with non-standard shells

Previously, logging into Cockpit was restricted to users who have a shell
specified in [/etc/shells](https://linux.die.net/man/5/shells), enforced
through [`pam_shells`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_shells). This was found
to be too strict, and excludes users with e. g. the `tlog-rec-session` shell for
[session recording](https://github.com/Scribery/tlog).


Cockpit now accepts shells that are unchangeable by non-administrastors, yet
still allow a user to log in. However, shells which do not allow a user to log
in, such as /sbin/nologin or /bin/false, may still be used to deny access to
Cockpit.
