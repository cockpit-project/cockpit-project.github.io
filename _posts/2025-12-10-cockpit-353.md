Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 353:


## Networking: Suggest prefix length and gateway address

IPv4 and IPv6 configuration dialogs now automatically pre-fill network prefix length and default gateway.
Prefix length defaults to classful addressing in IPv4 and /64 prefix is suggested for IPv6.
Classless addressing is fully supported and manual overrides are available, the default gateway is calculated as the first usable address of the subnet.
