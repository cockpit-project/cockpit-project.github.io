Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 211.

### Better support for various TLS certificate formats

Cockpit can now read certificates in a number of formats, such as the
one from LetsEncrypt.

Specifically, the web server now accepts certificates in
`/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d` which have a `.crt` extension, in addition
to `.cert`. Also, private keys can now be in a separate file with a
`.key` extension.

### Switch from Zanata to Weblate

The Fedora project is [moving away from
Zanata](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-localization-platform-migrates-to-weblate/),
and so is the Cockpit project.  Translations are now maintained with
[Weblate](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/cockpit/).

### Overview layout optimizations

The cards of the Overview page now work better at various screen
resolutions.
