Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 343 and cockpit-machines 336:

## Machines: Graphical VNC and serial consoles have been improved

It is now easier to switch between these two console types, and also easier to launch a remote viewer. Cockpit can now add VNC and serial consoles to machines that are missing them, and can change the port and password of the VNC servers of individual machines.

## Machines: Control VNC console resizing and scaling

You can now explicitly control the graphical console's resizing and scaling behaviour in expanded mode:
 * "No scaling or resizing" gets you an 1-to-1 pixel perfect view of a remote desktop, but possibly with scrollbars, depending on the browser window size.
 * "Local scaling" scales the console in the browser and thus is compatible with small browser windows and large remote resolutions, but is harder to read.
 * "Remote resizing" asks the remote machine to set a native resolution that matches Cockpit's console view. This keeps crisp graphics, but may not be compatible with all operating systems.
