Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from versions 136 and 137.

### Reordered entries in the sidebar menu

As a followup to the new look, the entries in the sidebar menu have now been reordered in a more sensible fashion:

 * System information
 * Logs for troubleshooting
 * Configuring major subsystems: Storage, Networking
 * What's running: Containers and Virtual Machines
 * Implementation details: Admin accounts, Services/Units

Check out the screenshot below to see how this looks now.

### Storage management is more convenient

In order to make configuring storage more convenient, the Cockpit UI now prevents removing disks from a RAID when
removal would lead to data loss due to an insufficient number of remaining volumes in the RAID. Also, when creating
a Volume Group (LVM) or adding disk space to a Volume Group, unpartitioned space is now offered as a choice.
If selected, Cockpit automatically creates a partition before adding it to the Volume Group. Check out the screenshots
below to see how these features look.

### Consider user known_hosts for ssh connections

When managing remote machines, Cockpit now considers known host keys in the user's `~/.ssh/known_hosts` in addition to
the system-wide `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`. This makes Cockpit behave more like the standard ssh client.
