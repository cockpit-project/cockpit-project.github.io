Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 256 and cockpit-machines 255:


##  Clean up old self-signed certificates

Older versions of cockpit used to generate self-signed TLS certificates with 100 year validity periods.  Modern web browsers reject TLS certificates with such long expiry dates, and cockpit moved to generating shorter-validity certificates a while ago.  This version additionally adds a check for long-validity certificates issued by old versions of cockpit and reissues them if they're found.

## Storage: Add support for Stratis

Cockpit now supports the [Stratis](https://stratis-storage.github.io) local storage management technology.
