Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 165.

### Storage: Show more details of sessions and services that keep NFS busy

When trying to unmount an NFS share that is currently in use, Cockpit offers a
dialog to terminate the processes that keep it busy. That dialog now shows the
systemd service names, process command lines, and since when these have been
active. This allows the administrator a more informed decision whether it is
okay to forcefully terminate these.

### Machines: Detect if libvirtd is not running

The Virtual Machines page now detects if libvirtd.service is running. It offers
to start and optionally enable the unit if it is not currently running:

Previously it just showed that "no VMs are running", which was misleading.

_Thanks to suomiy for this improvement!_

### Machines: Show virtual machines that are being created

When creating a new virtual machine it takes a while to allocate and create the
disk image. During that time the new VM was not visible anywhere, which caused
the impression that the creation failed. Now the VM overview lists it
immediately with state "creating VM installation":
