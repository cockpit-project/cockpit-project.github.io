Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 214.

### Networking: List Firewall active zones when unprivileged

[firewalld](https://firewalld.org/) recently became more restrictive. Listing services in a zone is no longer possible for anyone but superusers. As a result, the Firewall page was empty in unprivileged mode.

With this new Cockpit version, the Firewall page shows active zones again, however without services listed.

### Selenium tests deprecation

The Cockpit team has adjusted many "verify" browser tests to be non-destructive. This reworking was done to allow test VMs to be reused without resetting, which was our primary remaining reason for still having the Selenium tests.

Compared to verify tests, Selenium tests are much harder to debug and coverage is not quite as complete. Therefore, we will no longer develop Selenium tests. Eventually, the Selenium tests will be completely removed.

If you work with the Selenium tests, please get in touch with us.
