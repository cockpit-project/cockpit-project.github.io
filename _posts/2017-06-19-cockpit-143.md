Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 143.

### "Software Updates" page for package based operating systems

There is a new "Software Updates" page for classic dnf/yum/apt based systems,
to complement the already existing one for OSTree on
[Atomic](https://www.projectatomic.io). This uses the [PackageKit
API](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/) for platform
independence. This feature is shipped in the new `cockpit-packagekit`
sub-package.

See it in action:

### Inline VNC consoles

The inline VNC console advertised in [Cockpit 142](http://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-142.html)
was not actually working from the released `cockpit-machine` package due to a
packaging problem. Cockpit 143 corrects this problem. Thanks to Marek Libra!

### Kubernetes RBAC authorization support

The Kubernetes page can now be used to log into Kubernetes installations that
use [RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/).

### RPM packages for IBM Z systems

The `cockpit-docker` RPM package is now being built on the s390x (IBM Z
Systems) architecture, as the Fedora Docker package is available there.
([#1462113](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462113))
