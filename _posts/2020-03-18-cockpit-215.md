Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 215.

### Networking: Show additional included ports in firewall zones

The Firewall page now shows ports that are directly added to a zone at the end of the services list.

### Docker: Deprecate `cockpit-docker` in favor of `cockpit-podman`

`cockpit-docker` is being deprecated in favor of `cockpit-podman`, and will not be
maintained upstream. We have stopped building it for Ubuntu ≥ 20.04,
Debian ≥ 11, and Fedora >= 32 (i. e. the current development series), but will keep it for the
stable releases (i. e. backports).
