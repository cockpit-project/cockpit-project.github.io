Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit 291, cockpit-machines 289.1, and cockpit-podman 68:


## Update to patternfly 5 alpha

Cockpit is now an "early adopter" of PatternFly 5. Everything should look the same. We ensured all functional and visual tests pass. While this should not affect people using Cockpit, it definitely will affect everyone developing for Cockpit. Read more on [our PatternFly 5 blog post](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/patternfly-v5-alpha.html).

## Option to use RAW volume during VM creation

Users can now choose RAW as the storage format for the primary disk of their VM during the VM creation process.

## Redesign VM's CPU configuration

The CPU model dialog and vCPU topology have been combined into a single field and a dialog. Additionally, a few minor improvements have been added, including vCPU maximum and vCPU count now being number inputs. Furthermore, the dialog layout has been updated to a vertical form.
