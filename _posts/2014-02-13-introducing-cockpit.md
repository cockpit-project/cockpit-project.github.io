Hopefully there'll be a video of the talk available soon. You can try
out the Cockpit prototype in Fedora like so:  
  
```text
# yum install --enablerepo=updates-testing cockpit
# setenforce 0 # issue 200
# systemctl enable cockpit-ws.socket
$ xdg-open http://localhost:21064

  
**Don't run this on a system you care about (yet).** Sorry about the
```

certificate warning. Groan ... I know ... working on that.  
  
Needless to say I'm excited about where this is going...
