Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 164.

### Storage: Usability improvements

We recently ran a usability study targeting the storage area. Based on the
findings, we redesigned and adjusted the NFS, VDO, and RAID storage devices.

Previously, Cockpit used checkbox "arming" and drop-down buttons to reveal
available actions. Usability tests indicated these interface elements
were too hard and unintuitive to discover. Cockpit now expresses these
concepts in a more straightforward way.

Available RAID and VDO actions are now directly shown next to the
corresponding device:

NFS mounts are now clickable:

Clicking an NFS mount now shows a new details page with directly
available actions:

### System: Show available package updates and missing registration

The System overview page now shows pending enhancements, bug fixes, and
security updates when they are available:

As unregistered RHEL systems cannot receive updates they now display a warning:

### System: Fix inconsistent tooltips

Before this release, the System page had three different styles of tool tips.
Thee have been unified to use the standard
[Bootstrap tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/)
like other Cockpit pages. Relatedly, the performance profile used a static blue
"i" for additional information. We removed the icon and attached the tooltip
directly to the profile name.

The navigation redesign in
[Cockpit 156](https://martinpitt.github.io/cockpit-project.github.io/blog/cockpit-156.html)
increased the width of host navigation items. As the navigation labels are no
longer truncated, their corresponding tooltips have been removed.

### Logs: Change severities

On the Logs page, the severity filter now displays the officially defined
[syslog(3) levels](https://linux.die.net/man/3/syslog) instead of the previous
Cockpit-specific names:

_Thanks to Kirill Glebov for this improvement!_

### Machines: Add error notifications

The Machines page now shows individual and dismissable error notifications for
all virtual machines:

### Accessibility improvements

This Cockpit release includes several accessibility fixes. Notably,
[ARIA markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA),
role tags, tabindex fixes, and several other improvements should help with
keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

There's still more accessibility related work to do, but these changes are
a step in the right direction.

### Reloading the page in the browser now reloads Cockpit package manifests

Cockpit now refreshes the navigation menu on a browser reload. Installing,
removing, or updating Cockpit-related packages previously required logging
out and back in to see the changes.
