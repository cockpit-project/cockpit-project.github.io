Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.

### Web server: Accept EC certificates

The `/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d` directory can now contain
[Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography) certificates in addition to the classic RSA ones.

### Storage: List all software devices in a single panel

This avoids showing empty panels for types of devices that you don't have.

### Redesigned notifications

This release of Cockpit features a new notification design,
which corresponds to the [alert component from PatternFly 4](https://pf4.patternfly.org/components/Alert/examples/).
