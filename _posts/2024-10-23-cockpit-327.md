Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 327:


## Connect to similar servers without Cockpit installed

Support for connecting to remote machines without Cockpit installed now extends to the standard Linux distribution packages.

The [Cockpit Client flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient) has been capable of connecting to remote machines without Cockpit installed since its beginning in [release 295](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-295.html) and the [cockpit/ws container](https://quay.io/repository/cockpit/ws) since [version 326](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-326.html) recently added this functionality.

To ensure compatibility and safety, package-installed versions of Cockpit only allow connections to remote machines without Cockpit running the same operating system version. Future releases may relax this limitation.
