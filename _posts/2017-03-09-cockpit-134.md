Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 134.

### Login page is now translatable

The majority of Cockpit has long been translatable. Since the login page is a bit of a special case, it required some
special attention to make that also play well with the language display settings. Take a look at the video below for a demo.
Check out the Zanata link below, it's very easy to contribute translations to Cockpit.
At this time our top 3 translations (>90%) are Polish (pl), Ukranian (uk) and Chinese (zh-CN). Every bit of help
here is greatly appreciated and a big thank you to our contributors!

### Show message of the day on the System page

Cockpit now supports one more feature it was previously missing compared to the command line login: the ```System```
page now shows the current message of the day (```/etc/motd```). When dismissed by clicking on the ```X``` close button,
the message is hidden until it changes.

### Expose fewer system service actions

Cockpit previously exposed systemd unit actions such as ```Reload or Try Restart``` which are primarily intended for
scripts. The dropdown list now only shows actions which are useful for interactive human usage: ```Start```, ```Stop```,
```Restart``` and ```Reload```.
