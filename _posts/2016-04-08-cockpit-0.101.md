Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). There's a new release every week. Here are the highlights from this weeks 0.101 release.

### Kubernetes Volumes

You can now set up Kubernetes [persistent volume claims](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) through the Cockpit cluster admin interface. These volumes are used to store persistent container data and possibly share them between containers. Each container pod declares the volumes it needs, and when deploying such an application admins configure the locations to store the data in those volumes.
