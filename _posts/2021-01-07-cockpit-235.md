Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).  We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 235.

## Login: Improved handling of SSH host keys

This release improves key management while logging into secondary hosts. The log in screen now explains unknown and altered keys&mdash;and also how to verify these new keys. Browsers remember accepted keys in client-side storage to improve the user experience.

## Overview: Editable motd

The Overview page's motd now has an edit button to change `/etc/motd`.
