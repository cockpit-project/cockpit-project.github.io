Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 193.

### Machines: iSCSI direct storage pools

You can now add an iSCSI direct target as a storage pool for your virtual
machines.

_Thanks to Han Han for this improvement!_

### Storage: The "Format" button is no longer hidden

The button to format a block device used to be in the tab that describes the
current content of the device, such as in the "Filesytem" or "Physical Volume"
tab. Now it is in the header row where it should be easier to find.

### Storage: Improve performance with many block devices

Cockpit now survives much better when there are thousands of block devices on
the Storage page.
