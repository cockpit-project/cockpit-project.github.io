Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit-machines 293:


## Show virtual interface's TAP device

Network interfaces attached to VMs have a TAP device assigned, which represents the device at lower layers. Troubleshooting the virtual network device may require knowledge of the associated TAP device.

## Machines: Confirm shutdown actions

Ask for confirmation for every action which can cause downtime. The modal also shows uptime to help user from accidentally taking down a VM with a long uptime.
