Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 253 and cockpit-machines 252:


## SELinux: Dismiss multiple alerts

SELinux alerts can now be selected and dismissed in bulk, which is simpler than having to expand and dismiss them individualy. Having a clean alert state is especially helpful when building policies, as newer alerts become more obvious.

## Machines: Add support for renaming VMs

The Machines page can rename virtual machines.
