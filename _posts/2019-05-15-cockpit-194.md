Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 194.

### Firewall: Add services to a specific zone

The firewall page now supports zones.

Services can now be added to and removed from specific zones.

Additionally, dialogs on the Firewall page now show error messages.

### Redesigned on/off switch

This release of Cockpit features a redesigned on/off switch.  Compared
with the old version, the new switch is easier to use (with a bigger
clickable area), uses iconography to avoid translation problems, is
accessible, and is keyboard-navigatable.  The new design corresponds
to the design of the
[switch from PatternFly 4](https://pf4.patternfly.org/components/Switch/examples/).

The switch also features a native-like keyboard focus indicator: a blue glow for
Chrome/WebKit-based browsers and a dotted outline for Firefox.
