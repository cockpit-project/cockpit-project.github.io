We're organizing a Cockpit workshop in Berlin on the 19th and 20th of October, the two days preceding the [All Systems Go! conference](https://all-systems-go.io/), the successor to last year's systemd.conf.

The idea is to bring the Cockpit community together to help each other out in various areas relating to Cockpit. For example: getting started writing a module, tackling beginner tasks, or understanding Cockpit's general architecture.

If you're interested, please let us know that you're planning on coming [on the list](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/cockpit-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org/thread/KFHYTTUK4YK3JDKDXDMB4ONQNLZRJR6V/) and which topics you'd like to learn or teach about. This will help us to plan accordingly.

Also, spread the word if you like the idea!
