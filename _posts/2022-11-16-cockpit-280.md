Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 280:


## Disallow root login by default
On all operating systems, logging in as root with a username/password via SSH has been disallowed for a long time. Cockpit now also disallows it by default on new installations, but still allows it on upgrades for backwards compatibility. You can configure this in `/etc/cockpit/disallowed-users`.
