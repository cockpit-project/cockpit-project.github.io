Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 357, cockpit-files 37, cockpit-machines 350 and cockpit-podman 123:

## Show browser context menu when holding shift

To help with accessibility and user-specific items in your browser context menu we now follow the behavior seen
in Firefox: holding the "Shift" key while right-clicking will skip our own context menu and instead follow the
default behavior of your browser.  Note that while Cockpit Files uses the Cockpit context menu it did not
receive this update before the release, but will get it for the for next one.

## Machines: Support for kernel boot arguments when creating VMs

Cockpit now supports the `--extra-args` option of `virt-install`. This allows you to pass arguments to the
kernel when the installer is booted during the creation of a new virtual machine. Installers like Anaconda and
Agama can be controlled in various ways via these arguments.

Thanks to [Nykseli](https://github.com/Nykseli) for this contribution!

## Podman: Show description, version and documentation image labels

The image details tab now shows a select set of labels from the [opencontainers annotations
specification](https://specs.opencontainers.org/image-spec/annotations/). This is particularly useful to find
out what version the `latest` tag of an image is.
