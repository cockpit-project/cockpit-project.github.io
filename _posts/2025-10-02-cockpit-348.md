Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit-machines 341:

## Machines: Improved UX for Disks and Network interface tables

Looking at a Virtual Machine's available disks or the designated network interfaces there was too much detail being displayed, causing unintended wrapping and making some parts impossible to read with certain screen resolutions.

To alleviate this we have changed the UI around to showcase only the most important information a user would want and hid the rest within an expandable section.

All the information we had prior to this change is still here, but in a much easier to read design.
