summary: 'Improved warnings when connecting to remote hosts and Cockpit Files learns how to create new files'
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit 329 and cockpit-files 12:


## Shell: Improve warning when connecting to remote hosts

While [Cockpit 322](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-322.html) deprecated the "host switcher" on newer distribution versions, connecting to hosts within Cockpit is still possible on older distribution versions or when using a specific override in `cockpit.conf`. Cockpit now displays a clear warning when connecting to a remote host, as all connected hosts can control each other.

This warning can be disabled by including the following in `/etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf`:

```
[Session]
WarnBeforeConnecting=false
```

## Files: File creation support

Create new files directly in Cockpit Files. Enter the file name and content. Ownership is automatically determined from the current directory, but can be changed if needed.
