Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). There's a new release every week. Here are the highlights from this weeks 0.114 release.

### Test every change on CentOS

Cockpit runs all its tests suites against code before that code is merged, much less
becomes part of a release. This isn't just unit tests, but integration booting of
RHEL, Debian, Fedora and Atomic machines.

We now added CentOS to that list. We now boot CentOS 7.x instances many hundreds of times
a day to test aspects of the system, and how Cockpit and a given pull request interact with it.

### Show SSH host keys and machine ID

The main system info page now shows the
[local machine ID](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machine-id.html) for
easy access.

You can also see the fingerprints of all the [SSH host keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).
These are the fingerprints that you would be expected to recognize and/or add to the
```known_hosts``` file when accessing the machine over SSH.

### Allow changing the ethernet MTU

You can now change the ethernet
[maximum transmission unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) in the
network configuration.

### Show intelligent password error messages

When choosing a password Cockpit validates the password using the ```pwscore``` tool.
Appropriate and descriptive error messages are now shown when the validation fails:

### Red Hat subscription registration options

The Red Hat subscriptions functionality has been enhanced. You can now specify an activation
key when registering the system. This key is generated in your organization in such a
way that it uniquely identifies whan kind of software should be available on the system.

You can now also specify an organization when registering the system.

### From the Future

Marek [is working on](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/4434) a new part of
the admin interface to list the virtual machines running on the current system. This is
the beginnings of a web accessible [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) tool:
