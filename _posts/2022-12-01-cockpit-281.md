Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 281 and cockpit-machines 279:


## Add style switcher

Override your system's style with Cockpit's new style switcher. It's great for the times when you might want a dark Cockpit but your system is in light mode. Or vice versa.

Additionally, some browsers have issues picking up on the correct system dark mode setting, so this lets you manually set the mode you prefer.

You can find the style switcher in the session menu.

## Machines: Autodetect disk image type in custom path

Cockpit Machines now detects the format of disks added using "custom path". Raw and qcow formatted disk images are supported. However, qcow2 images with a backing file are currently not supported.
