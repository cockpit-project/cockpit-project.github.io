Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 316, cockpit-machines 312, and cockpit-podman 87:


## cockpit.js API: Fix format_bytes() units

The [`cockpit.format_bytes()`](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit-util.html#cockpit-format-bytes) function now writes the unit for kilobytes as SI conformant "kB" instead of "KB" when formatting decimal (base-10) sizes. It also uses the unit "B" (bytes) for numbers less than 1000 instead of no unit at all.

Note that many projects, in particular the ones based on current [starter-kit](https://github.com/cockpit-project/starter-kit), bundle `cockpit.js` and usually also pin down a specific git commit from cockpit.git. So these projects won't immediately pick up the change, but should update the cockpit library import and possibly adjust their usage of `format_bytes()`.
