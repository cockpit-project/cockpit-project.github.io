Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 269 and cockpit-machines 269:


## Dark mode for Cockpit Client

The chrome of Cockpit Client now follows the system dark style preference.  We'll be adding dark mode for the content in the near future.

## Metrics: Show Podman containers in top CPU and memory lists

Current metrics cards for CPU and memory now show [Podman](https://podman.io/) containers, in addition to systemd services.

## Machines: provide default name for new VMs

If no name is specified for a new virtual machine, generate a unique name based on the name of the operating system. The autogenerated name is visible only after the operating system is selected.
