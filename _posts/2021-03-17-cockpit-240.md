Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).  We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 240.

## New localization: Norwegian Bokmål

Cockpit is now also available in Norwegian Bokmål localization. Thank
you Stein-Aksel Basma for this contribution!  Cockpit is being
translated in [Weblate](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/cockpit/master/),
where anyone can help to improve Cockpit.

## Performance metrics: Journal integration

The Metrics page identifies high CPU, memory, disk, and network resource usage. Now you can expand each of these "spikes" to view related log entries, to help identify resource hogs.

## Machines: Cloud image authentication

Distro cloud images have no login accounts by default. The user can
now specify the root and user account login credentials, which will be
passed to [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/).
