Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 317:


## webserver: System user changes

Cockpit has changed how the system user is handled. All supported distributions use the same system user names. We don't test, support, or recommend running the web server as root, which had previously been the default with an upstream build and install. Hence, the following `./configure` options related to static users have been removed:
 - `--with-cockpit-user`
 - `--with-cockpit-group`
 - `--with-cockpit-ws-instance-user`
 - `--with-cockpit-ws-instance-group`

The `cockpit-ws` system user is no longer statically created, but created transiently and on-demand via [systemd's `DynamicUser` feature](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#DynamicUser=). If you would like to remove the previously-used static system user:
 1. Upgrade to Cockpit 317 or later
 2. Run `systemctl stop cockpit`
 3. Run `userdel -r cockpit-ws`

The `cockpit-wsinstance` system user is now declared through [systemd-sysusers](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/sysusers.d.html#).

## Metrics: Grafana setup now prefers Valkey

The [Grafana metrics setup](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/pcp-grafana.html) now prefers using [valkey](https://valkey.io/) over [redis](https://redis.io/) on Fedora. See the [Fedora change proposal](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Replace_Redis_With_Valkey) for details.
