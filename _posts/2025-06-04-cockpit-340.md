Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 340, cockpit-podman 107, cockpit-machines 333, and cockpit-ostree 211:

## Storage: Prevent modifying unsupported partitions

Cockpit now detects unsupported partitions and displays a notice that Cockpit does not support it, such as modifying LVM2 Logical Volume partitions.

![Screenshot showing a notice inside a GPT partitions card saying "Unexpected partitions" in bold, followed by a description saying "Partitions are not supported on this block device. If it is used as a disk for a virtual machine, the partitions must be managed by the operating system inside the virtual machine."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/340-storage-unsupported-partitions.png)

## Storage: Rename safety warning

We now display a warning when renaming volume groups that contain the root filesystem as it might break the next boot.


## Podman: Quadlet log links

Quadlet logs now link to their systemd service log page counterpart.

## Machines: Virtual network interfaces can now select source mode

When adding a new virtual network interface you can now select between VEPA, Bridge, Private, or Passthrough for more flexibility with how machines are exposed to the network.

![Screenshot showing off new form selection, it includes an information button for "Source" as well as a radio button to select either VEPA, Bridge, Private, or Passthrough.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/340-machines-network-source-mode.png)
