Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 333 ðŸ¥ƒ, cockpit-podman 101, and cockpit-files 16:

## Files: Copy/paste ownership prompt

When logged in as administrator and copying files with a given owner to a
directory with a different owner, cockpit-files will now prompt for the desired
ownership of the copied files.
