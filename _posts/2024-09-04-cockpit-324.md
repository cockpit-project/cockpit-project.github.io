Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit-podman 94 and cockpit-files 7:


## Podman: Show ports as ranges

In container and pod details, Cockpit Podman shows contiguous ports as a range when they use the same protocol, host, or host IP.

## Files: Viewing and editing text files

Cockpit Files now supports viewing and editing small text files, perfect for quickly editing configuration files. Right click a file and select "Open text file" to edit.
