Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 173.

### Storage: Offer installation of VDO

The Storage page now shows an "Install VDO support" link if the
[VDO](https://github.com/dm-vdo/vdo) package is not installed. This is similar
to the on-demand installation of the NFS client packages in
[Cockpit 169](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-169.html).

### Machines: Add disks to a virtual machine

The "Disks" tab of a virtual machine now has an "Add Disk" button. Using
this new feature, it's possible to create a virtual disk in a
[libvirt storage pool](https://libvirt.org/storage.html) or attach an existing disk.
