Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 346, cockpit-machines 339, and cockpit-podman 113:


## Storage: Support for Stratis "V2" pools

Stratis 3.8 and newer will create pools with a new metadata format that allows multiple passphrases and keyservers. Cockpit now supports this new format.

## Support branding Cockpit pages

Cockpit's [branding CSS](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/doc/branding.md) so far only applied to the Login page and the Shell. With this version it gets applied to all Cockpit pages. This allows distributors more customization possibilities, such as changing [PatternFly brand colors](https://www.patternfly.org/design-foundations/colors/#brand-colors).

## Machines: Serial consoles now keep their content and stay alive

Cockpit Machines used to lose the content of a serial console when navigating away from a virtual machine, and it would be empty when returning to it later. Now the content will be preserved and the console will also pick up output that happened while the console was not visible.

## Machines: No longer copies qemu.conf values into VM definitions

Previously, Cockpit would copy the listening address and passwords for VNC and SPICE from the global qemu.conf configuration file into the definitions of new virtual machines.

This had the undesired effect that changes to qemu.conf made after these machines were created would not take effect for them.

Cockpit no longer does this. New machines will be created with no extra configuration for their VNC and SPICE devices, and thus the values in qemu.conf will be applied on each start of these machines.

## Podman: Sortable Images table

You can now sort the images table by any column.
