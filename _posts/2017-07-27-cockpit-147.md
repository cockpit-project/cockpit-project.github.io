Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 147.

### Add configuration of expiry to Accounts page

The Accounts page can now display and change the expiration of user accounts
and their passwords. Note that the login page supports changing expired
passwords.

See it in action:

Thanks to Fridolin Pokorny for this improvement!

### Consistently ignore loopback traffic on all network load graphs

The network load graphics on the System, Networking, and Dashboard pages
sometimes accounted traffic on the loopback network device (`lo`), which in
most cases is not interesting for administrators. Now the graphs always ignore
the loopback device.

### Fix the Kdump page in Internet Exporer

This page previously produced errors when being opened in Internet Explorer due
to using unsupported JavaScript functions. These got replaced.
