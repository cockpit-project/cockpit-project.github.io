_Thanks to Akshit Dua for this feature!_

### Machines: VM creation dialog now shows the recommended memory for the selected OS

During VM creation, memory fields are checked for validity. The Create VM dialog now displays a recommended RAM size for the selected OS and an error appears if memory is set too low.
