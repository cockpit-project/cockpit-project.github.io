Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 191.

### Machines: iSCSI storage pools

You can now add an iSCSI target as a storage pool for your virtual
machines.

common presentation now.

### Network: Firewall supports custom ports

In addition to services, which represent a predefined set of ports,
you now can now open individual ports in the firewall by directly
specifying their numbers.
