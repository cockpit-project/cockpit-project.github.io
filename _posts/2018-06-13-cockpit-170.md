Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 170.

### Software Updates: Layout rework

The Software Updates page has improved mobile browser support.

On desktop browsers, the updates list avoids line breaks in the version column.
Versions become truncated when there's not enough room to display the complete
string. Hovering over the shortened string shows the complete version.

### oVirt: Use authenticated libvirt connection by default

The [oVirt](https://www.ovirt.org/) version of the Machines page now uses a
TLS-enabled libvirt connection URI instead of `qemu:///`. This enables libvirt
operations that require authentication. One common example is sending an NMI.

A machines-ovirt.config file with a `VIRSH_CONNECTION_URI` option may override
the connection address.

_Thanks to Sharon Gratch for this improvement!_
