Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release
regularly. Here are the release notes from version 133.

### Remotely managed machines are now configured in /etc/cockpit/machines.d

Cockpit plugins, other packages, admins, VM management software, or config management systems like
Ansible/puppet/cloud-init might want to pre-configure machines for cockpit. Previously this information
was stored in ```/var/lib/cockpit/machines.json```, but now that information is stored in individual json
files in ```/etc/cockpit/machines.d```. Existing ```machines.json``` files are migrated automatically to the new
format. Check out the documentation below for more information on the format and use.

### Packages can register additional bridges

On the server side the ```cockpit-bridge``` connects to various system APIs. There are additional bridges for specific
tasks that the main ```cockpit-bridge``` cannot handle, such as tasks that should be carried out with privilege
escalation. These additional bridges can be registered in the ```bridges``` section of a package's ```manifest.json```
file. Check out the documentation below for more information on the format and use.

### Split translations into individual packages

Behind the scenes there's been a lot of work on making translations work more smoothly and future-proof.
As part of this the translations have been split into the individual packages, which also means they can be updated
per package in the future. Check out the Zanata link below, it's very easy to contribute translations to Cockpit.
At this time our top 3 translations (>90%) are Polish (pl), Ukranian (uk) and Chinese (zh-CN). Every bit of help
here is greatly appreciated and a big thank you to our contributors!
