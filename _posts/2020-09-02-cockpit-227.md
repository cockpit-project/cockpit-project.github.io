Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 227.

### Machines: Virtual machine list filtering

The Virtual Machine overview page can now be filtered by name and state.

### Continued PatternFly 4 migration

The Networking, Firewall, Services, and Storage pages use more [PatternFly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) elements, which improves accessibility and mobile views.

### Stop Fedora 31 releases

With [Fedora 33](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-33/f-33-key-tasks.html) nearing Beta, and Fedora 31 nearing its end-of-life, Cockpit will no longer have updates in Fedora 31.
