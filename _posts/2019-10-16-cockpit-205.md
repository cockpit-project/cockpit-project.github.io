Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 205.

### Firewall: UI restructuring

The firewall page was redesigned. Instead of having separate listings for services
and zones, the services are now listed per zone. This aims to make the relationship
between zones and services clearer.

Memory and storage size will be autofilled with recommended values for

### Refactor cockpit-tls

Instead of using our own the cockpit-ws instances, use systemd to start
cockpit.service which now activates scokets for http and https. This should
solve some security issues.
Create a new thread to handle each incoming connection instead of epoll.
