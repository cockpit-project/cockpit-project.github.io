Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 259, cockpit-machines 258, and cockpit-podman 38:

## Storage: More information in table rows

Table rows representing filesystems now show more information. You can
now immediately see the mountpoint and the usage, and there are also
links to the pages for volume groups.

## Cockpit Client

Cockpit now ships [Cockpit Client](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient) via [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/).

If you are on a Linux desktop, this is now the most convenient and secure way (no open ports other than ssh) of accessing remote servers or your local machine with Cockpit.
