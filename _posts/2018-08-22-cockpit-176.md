Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 176.

### Login: Suggest other browser when browser is unsupported

Some browsers are not supported, for instance because they don't support
WebSockets. Cockpit now shows a list of browsers which are known to work.

### PackageKit: Install auto-updates backend on demand

If no auto-update backend is installed, the user will be prompted for
installation when enabling auto-updates. Only systems where dnf-automatic is
available are currently supported.
