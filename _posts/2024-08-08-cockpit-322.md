summary: 'Host switcher is now deprecated and Cockpit Files adds permissions in details view'

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 322 and cockpit-files 5:

## Shell: Deprecate host switching

The "host switcher" at the top-left corner of Cockpit enables
connections to multiple machines using SSH, runs a Cockpit session on
each connected machine, and lets you switch between them.

Although this feature is useful, when numerous hosts are active, they
can potentially interact with each other in ways that might not be
expected within an SSH trust boundary. For example, when connecting to
an untrusted host from another host, it's assumed that the untrusted
host should not have access or control over the originating
host. However, due to web technology limitations, hosts may affect one
another through [direct remote
channels](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COCKPIT-870), [iframe
traversal](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-4032), [cache
poisoning](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-4037), and other
means.

After several months of research into current web technologies, we
found no way to prevent these concerns. Therefore, the Cockpit team
intends to disable the host switcher feature.

As a first step, the host switcher will be disabled by default in:
- Fedora 41 and later
- Debian Unstable and Testing
- CentOS Stream 10
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
- Arch Linux

The host switcher will stay as-is in current stable Linux
distributions. This includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, CentOS Stream
9, Fedora 39 and 40, Debian 12 "Bookworm", and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and
24.04 LTS.

### Alternatives

* The login page offers a "Connect to:" field which will directly
  connect to another host using SSH. This is safe as long as you only
  connect to a single host within a browser session. This will always
  be supported. However, this only supports user/password or Kerberos
  authentication, not SSH keys.

* On a Linux desktop, consider using the [Cockpit Client
  flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient). It
  supports password and SSH key authentication to any SSH host and can
  even provide a Cockpit session for machines which don't have *any*
  Cockpit packages installed.

* For custom pages that use channels (commands, file operations, D-Bus
  calls, etc.) on a remote machine, use the
  [cockpit-connect-ssh](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/pkg/lib/cockpit-connect-ssh.tsx)
  library to set up the SSH connection instead of relying on the host
  switcher.

### Mitigation

In the short term, you can re-enable host switcher functionality with
the `AllowMultiHost` option in
[cockpit.conf](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit.conf.5.html):

```ini
[WebService]
AllowMultiHost=yes
```

## Files: Permissions column in details view

A sortable permissions column is now available in the details view. It shows permissions grouped by who it applies to and further explains permissions using tooltips.
