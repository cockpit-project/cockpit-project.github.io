Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Today we celebrate the 300th release of Cockpit ðŸŽ‰. This is brought to you live
from a developer team gathering in the beautiful city of NÃ¼rnberg, Germany -- home of
world-famous visual artists like [Albrecht DÃ¼rer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer)
and [Garrett LeSage](https://github.com/garrett/)!

Today's versions primarily fix bugs, as they are the final stabilization for
the upcoming Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases. But we also have one nice new
feature for you.

## Storage: Support for growing block devices of a Stratis pool

Cockpit can now grow logical volumes that are used as block devices in a Stratis pool. Also, if a Stratis block device grows for any reason, Cockpit will notify you about this and can extend the pool to use all of it.
