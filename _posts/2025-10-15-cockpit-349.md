Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 349, and cockpit-podman 115:

## Package manifests: Add `any` test

[Package manifests](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/packages.html#package-manifest) can have a list of conditions.
Cockpit will only consider the package if *all* conditions are met. This release introduces an operator for alternative checks in a condition, for example

```json
"conditions": [
    {"any": [{"path-exists": "…/packagekit.service"}, {"path-exists": "…/dnfdaemon.service"}]}
]
```

That condition will be true if at least one of its subconditions matches.

## List stopped quadlets

Quadlets are a declarative way to define podman pods/containers using systemd-like configuration files.
These podman containers/pods are ephemeral and previously disappeared from cockpit-podman when stopped.

With this release, cockpit-podman can now detect stopped quadlets on the system for the logged in user and superuser.
The quadlets are shown as normal "inactive" pods/containers. In the future, lifecycle actions such as start/stop/restart will be added.
