Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 288, cockpit-machines 286, and cockpit-podman 65:


## Metrics: New design with more info in default view

The PCP metrics graphs have been redesigned so as to show by default more data in a single page view.

## API: Drop cockpit.dbus.publish() and .meta()

The `cockpit.js` library dropped these two functions, which were meant to create a D-Bus server object from inside a Cockpit page. No [known Cockpit project](https://cockpit-project.org/applications.html) has ever used this, and we are not aware of a good use case. If you are using this API, please [let us know](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues)!

## Accounts: Show more information for existing users

The accounts details page now shows user's home directory and default shell.

## Accounts: Allow specifying UID during account creation

UID should be a integer bigger or same than 1000. There are use cases
when user would want multiple accounts to share the same UID. In such
case, a secondary confirmation button is shown to let user know that
the account will be created with a non-unique UID. The default UID is
prefilled with the next available based on the users at /etc/passwd.

FIXME: I think explaining the non-unique scenario is an overkill - katerina

## Services: Pinned units need to be re-done

The data storage for "pinned" systemd units has changed. After upgrading to this Cockpit version, you need to re-pin units.

## Overview: Support for additional timeservers with chronyd

Cockpit can now configure additional time servers when chronyd is used to synchronize the clock. Previously, this was only supported with systemd-timesyncd.

## Storage: The "nofail" and "_netdev" options are exposed as a dropdown

New filesystems now default to "nofail", so that they wont prevent you from fixing things up with Cockpit again when they fail to mount on the next boot.

## Machines: Create VM based on cloud image and start it later

A cloud base image VM can now be created without immediately starting it by clicking "Create and edit", which was disabled until now. This allows users to configure additional VM properties (e.g. bootloader, boot order, disks, networking, etc.) before the VM is installed.

## Development: Cockpit now supports the esbuild bundler

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is a much faster bundler alternative for [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It also  natively understands [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), so that it is not necessary any more to use [babel](https://babeljs.io/). Cockpit's shared components and bundler plugins in [pkg/lib/](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/tree/main/pkg/lib) now support both eslint and webpack, so that projects can pick either. [cockpit-podman](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman) moved to esbuild in [this commit](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/commit/d48f58297f66d2f6390aa85b54883d9be980850b). You may choose to do the same for your project.
