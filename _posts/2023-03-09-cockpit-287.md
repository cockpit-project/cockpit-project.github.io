Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 287 and cockpit-podman 64:


## Services: Pinned units need to be re-done

The data storage for "pinned" systemd units has changed. After upgrading to this Cockpit version, you need to re-pin units.

## Overview: Support for additional timeservers with chronyd

Cockpit can now configure additional time servers when chronyd is used to synchronize the clock. Previously, this was only supported with systemd-timesyncd.

## Development: Cockpit now supports the esbuild bundler

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is a much faster bundler alternative for [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It also  natively understands [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), so that it is not necessary any more to use [babel](https://babeljs.io/). Cockpit's shared components and bundler plugins in [pkg/lib/](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/tree/main/pkg/lib) now support both eslint and webpack, so that projects can pick either. [cockpit-podman](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman) moved to esbuild in [this commit](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/commit/d48f58297f66d2f6390aa85b54883d9be980850b). You may choose to do the same for your project.
