summary: Cockpit releases regularly. Network Checkpoints and other highlights from
  version 121
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release
regularly. Here are the release notes from version 121

You'll notice that we've dropped the ```0.x``` from the beginning of the
version numbers. This underscores the fact that Cockpit is stable. We've been
regularly releasing functionally stable releases for most of the last year.

### Network Configuration Rollback

NetworkManager now has support in its API for detecting whether a network
configuration change broke connectivity to the system. Marius did work
so that Cockpit can detect this and have NetworkManager rollback the
changes that would have caused a remote admin to be disconnected from
the system.

This is similar to how a Linux desktop asks you to click in a dialog
if you accept the new display configuration. Except in the networking
case we can test the connectivity automatically.

### Debian Branding

Cockpit now shows proper branding when running on Debian, and uses the
logo installed on the system on its login screen.

### Fix Kerberos single sign on Debian and Ubuntu

Stef fixed Kerberos single sign on Debian and Ubuntu. More changes are
coming in the next release including support for use with
[gssproxy](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/gss-proxy) and expanding
support for non-Kerberos GSSAPI authentication mechanisms.


### Debugging info for Javascript and CSS

Cockpit now ships proper Javascript and CSS debugging "map" files in its
cockpit-debuginfo packages. These make it easier to troubleshoot issues
and develop code that runs in Cockpit.

### From the future

Peter is adding support for specifying an alternate server to connect
to on the login screen.

This completes the story of the "bastion host" which is accessible via
a web browser, in effect letting you connect via the Web Browser from
the login screen to other machines which only have SSH access available.
When using a bastion setup like this you only need a single trusted
TLS certificate and the remaining trust is ensured by SSH known host keys.

This feature will be used to implement click-through access to configure a host
in projects such as ManageIQ or RHEV.
