Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 213.

### Inline documentation

Cockpit has started to include documentation for specific features, such as network bonds.

We plan to expand this in the future and add many more short documentation popups.

### Support for transient virtual machines

Not all operations make sense for transient virtual machines, and Cockpit is now aware of that.

### Virtual machines can now use UEFI

Cockpit now supports selecting UEFI as the firmware for a new virtual machine.  This needs to be done before the first boot of that machine.

### Unattended virtual machine installation

When creating a virtual machine with a supported OS, Cockpit can install and configure that OS automatically, without requiring interactions.
