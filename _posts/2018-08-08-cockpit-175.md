Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 175.

### Storage: Key management for encrypted devices

This release adds encrypted storage support for passphrases and
network keyservers.

Under the hood, LUKSv1 manages encrypted devices, allowing up to 8
different key "slots". Each slot may contain a passphrase or can
provide NBDE by binding to a [Tang](https://github.com/latchset/tang)
server using [Clevis](https://github.com/latchset/clevis).

In a future release, we're planning to add key groups and more
authentication types. Key groups bypass the 8 slot limitation and
provide complex authentication rules. Stay tuned!
