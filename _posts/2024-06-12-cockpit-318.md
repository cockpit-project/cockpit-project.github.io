Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 318:


## Storage: Extra confirmation before deleting non-empty partitions in Anaconda's Web UI

When using Cockpit to manually configure storage during installation with the Web UI version of the Anaconda installer, operations typically involve empty partitions. For instance, someone might delete and recreate a partition with a different size or filesystem type. Since no actual data is deleted in these cases, such actions are usually harmless.

However, existing partitions with valuable data or other operating systems might also be present. To prevent accidental deletion, Cockpit now checks for files within a partition before deleting it and asks for additional confirmation if files are found.

## Discontinue Intel 32-bit Support in Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL

Beginning with Fedora 41 (currently in development as rawhide), Cockpit will no longer be built for the Intel 32-bit architecture (i686).

## cockpit.js: Get user primary group ID

The [cockpit.user()](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit-login.html#cockpit-user) API call now returns a new field `gid` with the user's primary group ID.
