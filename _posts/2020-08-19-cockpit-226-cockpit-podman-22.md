Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly. Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 226 and Cockpit Podman version 22.

### Storage: Better support for "noauto" LUKS devices

Cockpit better respects the LUKS "noauto" option for encrypted filesystems.

Previously, Cockpit would force a encrypted filesystem to mount at next boot when it was simply mounted within Cockpit. Now, encrypted filesystems set with "noauto" will remain unmounted during boot.

Please [refer to issue 14467](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/14467) for more details.

### Podman: Support for pod group deletion

The cockpit-podman plugin gained the ability to delete pod groups.
