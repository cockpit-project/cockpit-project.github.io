Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release
regularly. Here are the release notes from version 126 and 127.

### Show security scan information about container images

Lars did work to show security scan information about container images. The
displayed scans happen via the
[atomic scan](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/05/02/introducing-atomic-scan-container-vulnerability-detection/)
tools and the data comes from the [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) system.
Take a look at the video below.

### Choose whether password is cached and reused on the login screen

The typical workflow for peforming privileged tasks on a Linux system is to
log in as a non-root user and then use [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) or
[Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit) to escalate privileges.

Stef did work to make Cockpit's privilege escalation reflect this properly.
Cockpit now has an option on the login screen to
*Reuse my password for privileged tasks*. Checking this option automatically
performs reuses the login password as necessary to escalate privileges. If
you leave this box unchecked then Cockpit will behave exactly as a normal
user login without special privileges.

In the future we'll have a way to enable this option once logged in, and
retype your password inside of the logged in session.

Here's a video which shows how this works:

### The remotectl command can now combine certificate and key files

Peter did work to make it easier to use TLS certificate and key files with
Cockpit for port 9090. Normally the server certificate(s) and key need to be
combined into a single file and placed into the ```/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d```
directory. The ```remotectl``` command that comes with Cockpit can now be
used to build such a combined file:

```unknown
remotectl certificate server.pem chain.pem key.pem
```

Due to this, when Cockpit is deployed as an Openshift Pod it can use certificates
provided by Openshift.

### Cockpit respects /etc/shells

Martin fixed Cockpit so it only allows the user to log in if the user has a
valid shell listed in ```/etc/shells```. In addition bugs on Ubuntu and Debian
have been fixed where users were created without valid shells.

### Allow renaming of active devices in networking interface

You can now rename network devices like bonds or bridges while they're active.
The change will apply immediately and without any interruption in service.

### Rename cockpit-shell to cockpit-system

The ```cockpit-shell``` subpackage has been renamed to ```cockpit-system``` to
better reflect its focus: configuring and troubleshooting the local system.

### Kerberos authentication now work even if gss-proxy is in use

Sometimes Kerberos (or GSSAPI) single-sign-on authentication requires multiple
round trips to the server. Cockpit now supports this properly, and the end result
is that SSO works even when fancy things like
[GSS-Proxy](https://fedorahosted.org/gss-proxy/) are in use.
