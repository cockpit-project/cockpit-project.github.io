Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 151.

### Support loading SSH keys from arbitrary paths

The User menu's Authentication dialog now supports entering arbitrary paths to
SSH keys for adding to the SSH authentication agent. Previously this only
offered keys present in the standard `~/.ssh` home directory.

### Support X-Forwarded-Proto HTTP header for Kubernetes

Newer Kubernetes versions support reading the
[X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto)
HTTP header, which helps to determine whether or not a client used SSL to
connect to an intermediate proxy, load balancer, or similar. Cockpit's
Kubernetes (Cluster) dashboard now sets this header. Earlier versions have
already done that when hosted in OpenShift.

### Fix Kubernetes connection hangs

The previous Cockpit release 150 introduced a regression when connecting to
Kubernetes clusters. In some cases, like specifying a wrong server name or when
the Cluster did not send Authentication Provider information, the connection
attempt would hang indefinitely. This version corrects this bug.
