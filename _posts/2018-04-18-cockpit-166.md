Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 166.

### Kubernetes: Add creation of Virtual Machines

The KubeVirt Virtual Machines page now offers a "Create" button for defining a
new virtual machine. The JSON definition can be provided with a file upload,
with drag & drop, or by copy & pasting. See it in action:

_Thanks to suomiy for this improvement!_

### Realms: Automatically set up Kerberos keytab for Cockpit web server

When joining a FreeIPA domain, Cockpit now automatically sets up Kerberos
[Single Sign-On](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/sso.html) for its web
server. With that, users with a valid kerberos ticket (from `kinit`) will be
logged into Cockpit without having to go through the login page.

### Numbers now get formatted correctly for the selected language

Numbers like disk sizes or network bandwidth usages are now shown with the
correct decimal separator for the current browser language.
