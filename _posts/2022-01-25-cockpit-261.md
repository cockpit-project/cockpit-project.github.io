Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 261 and cockpit-podman 40:


## Storage: Unmounting or deleting a busy filesystem is now supported

Cockpit can now stop processes and services that keep a filesystem busy before unmounting or destroying a filesystem.

This is accompanied by a general improvement in how destructive actions are summarized in their dialogs.

## Podman: Add pause/resume to containers

Add the pause and resume options — already available for pods — to
individual containers. Also make the order of the menu options the same
for pods and containers and add "Force restart" to the pod actions.

## Podman: Add option to pull the latest image when creating a new container

When the `:latest` tag of an image is available locally, but a newer version is available on the image registry, checking the "pull latest image" checkbox will now pull the latest version before creating the new container
