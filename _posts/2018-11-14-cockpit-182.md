Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 182.

### Machines: Add libvirt connection choice in VM creation dialog

The VM creation dialog now offers different connections to libvirt. The options
result in either a user session or system URI.

_Thanks to Katerina Koukiou for this improvement!_

### Software Updates page improvements

Update severity icons now have tooltips. The severity shown is equal to the
severity of the update with the highest severity among the available updates for
a package.

If the system is not registered, the Software Updates page now always points
this out. This avoids confusion if there are available updates from third-party
repositories, but the system as a whole still does not receive updates.
