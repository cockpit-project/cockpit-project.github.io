comments: 'true'
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 198.

### PatternFly4 user interface design

Cockpit has been restyled to match the
[PatternFly 4](https://pf4.patternfly.org/components/Button/examples/)
User Interface design, including the
[Red Hat Text and Display fonts](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont).

This style refresh aligns Cockpit with other web user interfaces that use
[PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/), such as
[OpenShift 4](https://www.redhat.com/en/openshift-4).

Over time, Cockpit will be ported to actually use PatternFly 4 widgets, but
this restyle allows us to change Cockpit gradually.

### SELinux: Show changes

The SELinux page now has a new section "System Modifications" which shows all
policy settings that were made to the system (with Cockpit or otherwise):

The "View Automation Script" link will show a dialog with a shell script that
can be used to apply the same changes to other machines:

### Machines: Deletion of Virtual Networks

The Virtual Networks section of the Machines page now supports deleting networks.

### Machines: Support more disk types

When creating a new VM, the disk can now be on a storage pool type other than a
plain file. The newly supported types are iSCSI, LVM, and physical volumes.

### Docker: Change menu label

The menu label changed from "Containers" to "Docker Containers". This avoids
confusion with the "Podman Containers" page from
[cockpit-podman](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman), and points
out that this page really is about Docker only, not any other container
technology.

### Web server: More flexible https redirection for proxies

[cockpit-ws](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit-ws.8.html) now
supports redirecting unencrypted http to https (TLS) even when running in
`--no-tls` mode. Use this when running cockpit-ws behind a reverse http proxy
that also supports https, but does not handle the redirection from http to
https for itself. This is enabled with the new `--proxy-tls-redirect` option.
