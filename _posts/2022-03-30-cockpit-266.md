Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 266:


## Standardize on SI-based units for data sizes and rates

Physical storage, network devices, and network transmission speeds have all been sold and used in decimal units for a long time. As of this release, all sizes and rates are now shown in SI units (International System of Units), such as "MB" or "kB/s". This aligns Cockpit with what most users expect. It also avoids some inconsistencies, such as the Metrics page showing available/used RAM in decimal units, but the memory usage of individual services in binary units.

Only total RAM size on the Overview, the size of individual RAM modules on the Hardware Details page, and the size of KDump memory are shown in binary units such as MiB or GiB.
