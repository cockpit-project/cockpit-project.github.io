Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 307:

## Storage redesign

The Storage page has been redesigned with the goal of making more things visible in all views. The overview page now shows all storage objects in a table and almost all operations can be performed on them right from the table.

Clicking on a row navigates to a page dedicated to the object in that row, with more information and in some cases, additional actions.

Future releases will continue to improve the Storage page by adding filtering options and extending the actions and dialogs.
