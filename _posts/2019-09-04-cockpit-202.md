Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 202.

### Machines: Creation of Storage Volumes

Creation of Storage Volumes is now possible for a subset of the supported Storage Pool types.
The Storage Volumes can then be used as virtual disks for VMs.

### Improved component for selecting paths on the filesystem

The component used in dialogs for selecting paths on the filesystem was improved in order to be keyboard navigatable and accessible.
Multiple dialogs such as SSH key authentication from the Shell, Create VM and Create Storage Pool from Machines Page benefit from this change.
