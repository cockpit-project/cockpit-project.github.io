### From the future

Stef has done work to cleanup the Javascript dependencies of Cockpit. Broadly these fall into two categories:

* Development dependencies: only used while developing Cockpit, not even used while building the tarball. These are ```node_modules```

* Runtime dependencies: used while Cockpit is running and built
into the various Cockpit packages. These are ```bower_components```

The latter should be replaceable at build-time. The cleanup work moves in this direction, but it's not complete yet.
