summary: Cockpit with Dashboard and Machines improvements
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly. Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 232.

### Improved host editing

When editing the parameters of a host in the Shell or the Dashboard pages,
Cockpit no longer tries to change the name of the remote host.
Instead, it will now connect to the newly-entered hostname.

### Machines: Inline error messages

Error notifications for machines, storage pools and virtual networks are now displayed
in a popover next to the resource's state.
