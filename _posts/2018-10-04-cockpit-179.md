Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 179.

### Machines: Detach disk support

When using the libvirt D-Bus provider, the Machines page now supports detaching
a disk from VMs.

_Thanks to Katerina Koukiou for this improvement!_

### Machines: Offer cockpit-machines as Application

This Cockpit version adds AppStream metadata for its own `cockpit-machines`
package (which is not installed by default). Once `appstream-data` gets updated
again in Fedora, cockpit-machines will appear on the Applications page as an available
extension.
