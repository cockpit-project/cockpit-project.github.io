Effective today, the Cockpit Project is moving our primary online discussion forum from IRC to Matrix.

You can now find us in [`#cockpit:fedoraproject.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#cockpit:fedoraproject.org).  You can follow the link to login using an existing Matrix account, or easily create a new one using a variety of single sign-on parters (including GitHub and GitLab).

The old IRC channel on libera.chat has been discontinued. It is no longer possible to write messages there.  We’ve elected not to bridge the channel, mostly on account of recent reliability issues.

Honestly, we’re a bit sad to be leaving IRC after so long.  Matrix is a secure (end-to-end encrypted) and decentralized (server federated) platform with open specifications and many Free Software implementations of both clients and servers.  It has a strong IRC-based heritage.  It was a natural choice for our project.

We look forward to seeing you there!
