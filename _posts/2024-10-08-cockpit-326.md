Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 326, cockpit-podman 96, and cockpit-files 9:

## cockpit/ws container: Connect to any Linux server

The [quay.io/cockpit/ws](https://quay.io/repository/cockpit/ws) container provides Cockpit's web server in environments such as Kubernetes and [Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/), connecting to a remote machine via `ssh`.

Now, the cockpit/ws container gained the ability to connect to _any_ Linux server, even those without Cockpit installed. This provides a convenient way to perform basic administration tasks remotely. This is similar to the [Cockpit Client flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient) ([available since release 295](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-295.html)), but can run anywhere an OCI container can run.

Currently, the following pages are available when connecting to a server without Cockpit: Overview, Metrics, Terminal, Accounts, and Networking.  More pages will be added soon, after vetting them for this use.

## cockpit/ws container: Support host-specific SSH keys

The [cockpit/ws](https://quay.io/repository/cockpit/ws) container now supports adding multiple SSH private keys.

In addition to the existing `$COCKPIT_SSH_KEY_PATH` environment variable, you can now set host specific `$COCKPIT_SSH_KEY_PATH_{HOSTNAME}` variables, where `{HOSTNAME}` is the host name (in capital letters) used in the `Connect to:` field of the login page.

_Thanks to [benniekiss](https://github.com/benniekiss) for contributing this feature!_

## Bridge supports PCP; cockpit-pcp package is now obsolete

The Python cockpit-bridge, introduced in Cockpit 294, now implements PCP functionality. As a result, the separate cockpit-pcp package is now obsolete.

## Storage: Manage Stratis virtual filesystem sizes

Cockpit supports seting a default and maximum size limit for Stratis virtual filesystems, both during creation and when making adjustments.

## Podman: pull images from registries without search API

Container creation now supports registries lacking a search API, including GitHub's container registry (ghcr.io). You can also select a specific tag for images.

## Files: basic keyboard shortcuts
