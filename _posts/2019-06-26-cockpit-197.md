Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 197.

### Machines: Support all storage pool types for new disks

A cockpit user can now add a disk to a VM either by creating a new volume or
by choosing an existing volume, which can now reside on [any libvirt-supported pool
type](https://libvirt.org/storage.html#StorageBackendDir).

### Machines: Show available space on host at VM creation

When creating a new disk during VM creation, the dialog now has an indication
of the available space on the destination storage.
This prevents the user from overallocating storage to VMs which would lead to
installation failure.
