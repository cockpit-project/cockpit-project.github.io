Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 187.

### Machines: More operations for Storage Pools

You can now activate, deactivate, and delete the storage pools for
your virtual machines.

### Domains: More information about the joined domain

Clicking on the name of the joined domain will now open a dialog with
more information about that domain.

You can also leave the domain from this dialog.

### Storage: The options for VDO volumes are explained

When creating a VDO volume, the options are now explained with
tooltips.

### Machines: Support for oVirt will be dropped in the future

The oVirt project is mostly stalled and thus we don't plan to invest
much in Cockpit's oVirt support either.  Cockpit will keep the current
support for oVirt in stable distributions, but will no longer provide
it from Fedora 30 and RHEL 8 on.
