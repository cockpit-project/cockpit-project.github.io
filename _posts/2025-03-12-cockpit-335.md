Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 335 and cockpit-machines 329:


## Storage: SMART device health

The Storage page now shows disk device health and can run disk self-check tests on demand.

## Machines: Fix remote viewer launching

The "Launch viewer" button in Cockpit Machines now reliably launches "virt-viewer". The fix adds a generated filename to the `application/x-virt-viewer` helper file, resolving browser-specific launch issues. The filename also clarifies the file's purpose in the downloads folder.
