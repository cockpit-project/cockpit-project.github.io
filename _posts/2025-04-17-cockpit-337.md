Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 337, cockpit-podman 104,
cockpit-files 19, cockpit-machines 330, and cockpit-ostree 208:

## A fresh new style, upgraded to PatternFly 6

Cockpit features a refreshed style, thanks to the latest major version of [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/). This update replaces the previous "industrial" look with a more modern "airy" design, featuring even more rounded corners, fewer borders, and improved visual consistency. This release also includes numerous UI-related bug fixes.

The visual changes apply to the core Cockpit interface and all official plugins (including cockpit-files, cockpit-machines, cockpit-podman, and cockpit-ostree). We have tested the new look in both light and dark styles, verified accessibility, and confirmed compatibility with right-to-left (RTL) languages. We are happy with the state of the migration and are ready to share it with everyone.

If you do encounter any issue, [please file a bug report to let us know](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)!

For plugin developers: We wrote [a guide for upgrading to PatternFly 6](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/discussions/21753).

## Software updates: Support `dnf needs-restarting`

On CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10, the Software Updates page uses `dnf needs-restarting` to check if updates only need service restarts or require a full reboot. This replaces the `tracer` tool previously used in version 9.


## Podman: Link service containers to service pages

Containers managed by systemd link to the Services page, where these containers can be stopped or restarted.

## Podman: Connect to other accounts with containers

Administrators sometimes run services as unprivileged containers on other system user accounts, for isolation purposes. These system users typically don't have a password and thus one cannot log into Cockpit as a system user.

When starting, Cockpit Podman scans the system for other accounts with running containers and provides a means to connect to Podman services on other accounts.

Note that you can only connect to one account at a time, to avoid breaking isolation.

## Files: Symbolic link creation

Create symbolic links (symlinks) for files and directories by right-clicking and selecting the `Create link` menu entry. Both relative and absolute path symlinks are supported.
