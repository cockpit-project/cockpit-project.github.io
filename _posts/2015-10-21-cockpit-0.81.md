Cockpit releases every week. This week it was 0.81


### NTP servers

Cockpit now allows configuration of which NTP servers are used for time syncing.  This configuration is possible when [timesyncd](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-timesyncd.service.html) is being used as the NTP service.

### Network switch regression

There was a regression in Cockpit 0.78 where certain on/off switches in the networking configuration stopped working. This has now been fixed.


### Delete Openshift routes and deployment configs

In the Kubernetes cluster dashboard, it's now possible to delete Openshift style routes and deployment configs.

### From the future

I've refactored the Cockpit Kubernetes [container terminal widget](https://github.com/kubernetes-ui/container-terminal/) for use by other projects. It's been integrated into the Openshift Web Console for starters. This widget will be used by Cockpit soon.
