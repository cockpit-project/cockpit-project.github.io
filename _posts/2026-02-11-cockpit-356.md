Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 356:


## Services: Timers created by Cockpit run shell commands and can be edited

The systemd timer units created by Cockpit now run their command via
the shell. Previously, the text you entered into the "Command" field
was used directly for the ExecStart value in the systemd service unit
for the timer, and was thus subject to systemd specifier expansion and
other idiosyncrasies. Now the text you enter is executed directly by `/bin/sh`.

Systemd timer units that have been created by this version of Cockpit
(or later) can now also be edited in Cockpit.

Thanks to [Miguel Ribeiro](https://github.com/miguelbribeiro) for contributing this feature!
