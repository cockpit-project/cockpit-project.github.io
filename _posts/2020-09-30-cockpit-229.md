Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly. Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 229.

### Shell: Any page can be the shell

Cockpit has long had a configuration option to replace the default shell with something else. Shell replacement has now been documented and bugs have been fixed to allow any Cockpit page to assume the role of the shell. Additionally, this change enables support for third-party custom shells.

To see this in action with the terminal, place the following in `/etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf`:

```
[WebService]
Shell = /system/terminal.html
```

&hellip;and _nothing but the terminal_ will be shown after logging into Cockpit.
