Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 189.

### Machines: Import existing image

You can now choose an existing qcow image when creating an new VM. This will not
run an installer, but just import it into libvirt.

### Machines: Show virtual networks

Show the details and properties of virtual networks.

_Thanks to Simon Kobyda for this feature!_

### Services: Filtering of services

Services can now be filtered using text. Results can be filtered additionally by
name, description, and state.

In addition, service states have been merged into one list. The switcher buttons
at the top have also been changed to tabs to make switching more obvious.
