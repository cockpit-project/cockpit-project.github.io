Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 286, Cockpit-machines 284, and
Cockpit-podman 63:


## Metrics: Toggle visibility of resource usage graphs

On the Metrics page, which can be found by following the link from the Overview, you can see a historical graph of CPU, memory, storage IO, and network. This release adds the ability to toggle the visibility of individual types of resources in the graph.
