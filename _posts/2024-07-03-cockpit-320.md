Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 320:


## pam-ssh-add: Fix insecure killing of session ssh-agent [CVE-2024-6126]

### Affected systems
* **Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-derived distributions**: These distributions enable the deprecated `user_readenv` option by default in [the `pam_env` PAM module](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_env.8.html).
* **Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Arch, OpenSUSE**: Not affected by default. Only systems where the `user_readenv` option has been manually enabled.
* **Other Linux distributions**: Check `grep -r user_readenv /etc/pam.d`. If there is no output, you are not affected. Otherwise check if the "cockpit" PAM module directly or indirectly uses that option.

This is tracked as [CVE-2024-6126](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6126).

### Impact

Cockpit's `pam_ssh_add` module had a vulnerability when `user_readenv` is enabled on the system, as it inherits the settings from the system in `/etc/pam.d/cockpit`.

This could cause a Denial of Service if a locally-authenticated user could craft a `~/.pam_environment` file which would kill an arbitrary process on the system with root privileges when logging out of a Cockpit session.

### Fix

- Upgrade to **Cockpit version 320** to fix this issue.
- For older Cockpit versions, a [backportable patch is available](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/08965365ac311f906a520cbf65427742d5f84ba4).

### Workaround

If you cannot upgrade to Cockpit 320 or use the patch linked above, and may have potentially malicious local users on a system running Cockpit, you can mitigate this vulnerability:

- Remove the `user_readenv=1` option from the `pam_env.so` line in `/etc/pam.d/cockpit`.

This will disable reading any extra environment variables in user's `~/.pam_environment` files, which is most commonly used to set a local environment different from the system default.
