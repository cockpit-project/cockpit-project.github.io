Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 282:


## Accounts: Redesign and include groups

The Accounts page has been redesigned. Groups are listed at the top of the page and the list of users is enhanced with details and filtering. Additionally, a user's groups can be edited while viewing details for the user.

## Right-to-left language support

Right-to-left language support has been enabled for languages that require it. When selecting a RTL language from the list, the layout will shift to be right-aligned.

We have also started modifying Cockpit and PatternFly to work better with RTL languages. However, there are still some alignment and spacing issues. We will continue to work to fix the more obvious problems.

If you know Hebrew (Cockpit's most complete RTL translation) or other RTL languages, please help us improve the implementation and translations by [filing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/new?labels=bug,i18n), sending pull requests, and/or [improving translations on weblate](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/cockpit/main/).
