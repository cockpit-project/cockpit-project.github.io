Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 157.

### Virtual Machine network devices

The Machines page overview lists all libvirt defined virtual machines, which
now have a "Networks" tab. This shows the virtual machine's network devices and
buttons to plug/unplug them.

Thanks to Bohdan Iakymets for this feature!

Before only PNG icons were supported.
