Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 279 and cockpit-machines 277:


## Beta Dark theme support

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17319>
{:.warn}

Cockpit now has dark theme support and automatically switches based on the system theme settings. The dark theme support is still a work in progress, so this feature is still in beta support in Cockpit.

## Machines: Allow unmap/trim requests by default for newly added disks

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/pull/839>
{:.note}

Allow unmap/trim requests by default for newly added disks

Libvirt and QEMU ignore unmap/trim requests by default unless specified
otherwise and stated they would not change this in order to not break
back-compatibility and instead recommends the upper layer to do this.
[1][2]
Most distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora already do periodic trim by
default. Virt-install also uses unmap/trim for the default disk of newly
created VMs. [3]
There is also discussion if we should expose the discard option in the
UI, since there are corner cases when the user might want the
unmap/trim requests to be ignored.
But either way, allowing unmap/trim requests is the correct thing to do,
regardless of whether it will get exposed in the UI or not.
