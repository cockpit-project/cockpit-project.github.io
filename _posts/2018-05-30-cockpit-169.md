Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 169.

### Storage: Offer installation of NFS client support

The "NFS Mounts" pane on the Storage page now shows an "Install NFS Support"
button if the necessary packages are not already available:

### System: Request FreeIPA SSL certificate for Cockpit's web server

When enrolling into a [FreeIPA](https://freeipa.org/) domain, an SSL
certificate is requested from the IPA server and stored in
`/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/10-ipa.cert`. Cockpit's web server will then use that
certificate instead of the default self-signed one.  The IPA server's
certificate authority is trusted by default and accepted by web browsers,
OpenSSL, curl, and other network clients.

### Services: Show unit relationships

The details of a systemd service now shows dependency, ordering, and other
relationships to units:

### Provide motd help about how to access cockpit

Cockpit now provides an `/etc/motd.d/cockpit`
[motd](https://linux.die.net/man/5/motd) message that explains how to enable
and start Cockpit if it's not running, or how to access it if it is running.

This requires [PAM 1.3.1](https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
and enabling the `pam_motd` module:

    session     optional      pam_motd.so
