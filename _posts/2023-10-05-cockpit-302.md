Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 302 and cockpit-podman 78:

## Storage: Partitions can be resized

Cockpit can now also resize partitions, including their content such as filesystems or LUKS containers.

## Podman: Label Toolbox and Distrobox containers

Podman now shows a visual label in the list of containers to differentiate [Toolbox](https://containertoolbx.org/) and [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) containers from other containers.
