Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 299:


## Kdump: Show location of kdump to verify the successful configuration test

You can now see the location where kdump can be found if testing of kdump settings is successful.

## Storage: Support for no-overprovisioning with Stratis

A Stratis pool can be put into a "no-overprovisioning" mode where the bad effects of running out
of space can be avoided via careful management of filesystem sizes. Cockpit now supports this mode.

## Storage: Cockpit can now add caches to encrypted Stratis pools

Encrypted caches are a new feature in Stratis 3.5, and now you can use it also from Cockpit.
Read more about Stratis cache in [Stratis release notes](https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-5-0/).
