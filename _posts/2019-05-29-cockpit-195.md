Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 195.

### Simplified support for external TLS termination

It's now easier to configure Cockpit's web server `cockpit-ws` to run
behind a
[TLS termination proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy).
If the proxy runs on the same machine, then `cockpit-ws` can be run with
the new `--for-tls-proxy` option, which will adjust the allowed
[Origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin)
and
[Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
to `https://` URLs. With this option, it's no longer necessary to
explicitly configure
[cockpit.conf](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit.conf.5.html).

### Firewall: More support for zones

In addition to the support for adding services to specific zones in the
last release, the firewall page now allows adding and removing of the zones
themselves.

### Machines: Additional storage options

During virtual machine creation it is now possible to select the
storage pool to use for the machine.

It is now also possible to create a storage pool using a physical disk
device as the backing store.

Finally, it is now possible to configure the disk cache policy when
adding storage devices to virtual machines.

### Machines: Support for changing memory allocation

The Machines page also gained support for changing the current and
maximum memory allocations of a virtual machine.

### Storage: Select encryption type separately from filesystem

The selection of the filesystem type and filesystem encryption options
have been uncoupled on the storage page, allowing for the use of LUKS
with filesytems other than ext4 and xfs.
