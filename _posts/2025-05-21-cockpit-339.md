---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 339, cockpit-podman 106,
cockpit-files 21, cockpit-machines 332, and cockpit-ostree 210:

## Add cockpit/ws arm64 container

The [cockpit webserver container image](https://quay.io/repository/cockpit/ws?tab=info) is now available for the arm64 architecture as well.

_Thanks to Marvin Ruder for this contribution!_

## Storage: Disk Self-Test error warnings

The health card on the overview page now provides proactive warnings when a disk reports errors from its SMART self-test.

## Machines: The "shareable" attribute of disks is no longer modified by Cockpit

By default, libvirt can attach a disk to multiple virtual machines, but if the disk allows writing, only a single one of these machines
can be running at a given time. Writing to a disk concurrently from multiple VMs at the same time can easily lead to data corruption,
and libvirt prevents this unless the "shareable" attribute of a disk is set. Previously, Cockpit would set this attribute by default
and would thus invite data corruption. To avoid this, Cockpit no longer marks disks as "shareable" when attaching them to multiple VMs.

Moreover, the "Edit attributes" dialog no longer allows setting the "shareable" attribute either.
We now believe this attribute is too dangerous to be exposed in such an easy way. If you really need it,
you can use "virt-xml" on the command line.
Cockpit will show disks with the "shareable" attribute as "Concurrently writable" in the UI.
