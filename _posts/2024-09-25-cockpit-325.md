Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 325 and cockpit-machines 320:

## Machines: Improvements to snapshots of running machines

When creating a snapshot of a running machine,  Cockpit asks where to store its memory file. This has improved in several ways:

 - Only a directory needs to be specified; Cockpit will generate a filename.
 - The snapshot dialog remembers the storage path, making future snapshots easier.
 - Space estimates are shown, including a warning if there isn't enough storage available.

## Machines: Support for VM descriptions

Cockpit can now show and change the descriptions of virtual machines.
