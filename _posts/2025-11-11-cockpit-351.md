Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 351, and cockpit-machines 344:


## Firewall: Additional ports can now be deleted

"Additional ports" in a firewall zone are now listed each in their
individual row, and can be individually deleted.

Thanks a lot libkurisu for this contribution!

## Machines: VMs can be shutdown and restarted with a single action

Some changes to a virtual machine, such as adding VNC graphics, require it to be completely shut down and restarted before these changes take effect. Cockpit can now do this with a single action.

## Machines: Support for network port forwarding

Cockpit can now configure port forwarding for virtual machines on the user session.
