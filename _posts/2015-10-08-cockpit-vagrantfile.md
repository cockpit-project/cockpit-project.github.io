Starting with Cockpit release 0.79 you can use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to bring up a VM in which
you can test or develop Cockpit. The VM is isolated from your main system so any system configuration
you change via Cockpit will only happen in the VM.

The Vagrant VM mounts the Cockpit package assets from your git repository checkout, so when you make on the
host system, you can refresh the browser and immediately see the resulting changes. For changes to
C code, the Cockpit binaries would have to be rebuilt and testing via Vagrant won't work.


## Getting Started

To start, you'll need Vagrant. On Fedora I use *vagrant-libvirt*. In addition keep in mind that on
*vagrant-libvirt* requires root privileges, so you'll need to use vagrant with `sudo`.

```text
$ sudo yum install vagrant vagrant-libvirt
```

Next, in a copy of the Cockpit git repository, you run `vagrant up`:


```text
$ git clone https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit
$ cd cockpit
$ sudo vagrant up
```

The first time this runs it'll take a while, but eventually you'll have a Vagrant VM running. When you
do this step again, it should be pretty fast.

The VM will
listen for connections on your local machine's [`http://localhost:9090`](http://localhost:9090), but
even though you're connecting to *localhost* it'll be Cockpit in the VM you're talking to.

If you already have Cockpit running on your local machine, then this won't work, and you'll need to
use the IP address of the VM instead of *localhost*. To find it:

```text
$ sudo vagrant ssh-config
```

Two user accounts are created in the VM, and you can use either one to log into Cockpit:

 * User: "admin" Password: "foobar"
 * User: "root" Password: "foobar"


## Testing a Pull Request

If there's a Cockpit [pull request](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pulls) that you'd like to
test, you can now do that with the Vagrant VM.  Replace the *0000* in the following command with the
number of the pull request:

```text
$ git fetch origin pull/0000/head
$ git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

The pull request can only contain code to Cockpit package assets. If it contains changes to the `src/`
directory, then the pull request involves rebuilding binaries, and testing it via Vagrant won't work.

Now refresh your browser, or if necessary, login again. You should see the changes in the pull request
reflected in Cockpit.


## Making a change

You can make a change to Cockpit while testing that out in your Vagrant VM. The changes should be
to Cockpit package assets. If you change something in the `src/` directory, then binaries will have
to be rebuilt, and testing it via Vagrant won't work.

I chose change some wording in the sidebar in `pkg/shell/index.html`:

```text
          <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tools-panel" class="collapsed" translatable="yes">
-           Tools
+           Beavers 'n Ducks
          </a>
```

And after refreshing Cockpit, I can see that change:

The same applies to javascript or CSS changes as well. In order to actually contribute a change to Cockpit
you'll want to look at the information about
[Contributing](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/wiki/Contributing) and if you need help
understanding how to add a
[plugin package](http://cockpit-project.org/blog/creating-plugins-for-the-cockpit-user-interface.html)
you can look at the [Developer Guide](http://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/development.html).


## Bringing the Vagrant VM in sync

After each Cockpit release, there will be new binary parts to Cockpit. In order to continue to use the
Vagrant VM, you'll need to rebuild it. A message like this should appear when that's necessary.

![Cockpit is incompatible with sources](/images/cockpit-incompatible-sources.png)

Rebuild the Vagrant VM like this:

```text
$ sudo vagrant destroy
$ sudo vagrant up
```

## Troubleshooting

On Fedora, FirewallD got in the way of Vagrants use of NFS. On my machine, I had to do this
to get it to work:

```text
$ sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=trusted
