Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit-machines 323 and cockpit-files 11:


## Machines: TPM improvements

Existing VMs using EFI but that do not have a TPM now have a menu action to add a TPM. This is especially useful for upgrading older VMs which have OS requirements that require a TPM, such as Windows 11.

Creating new VMs using EFI will automatically have a TPM created and configured.

## Files: Change permissions for enclosed files

When setting the permissions for a directory, there is now an action to also recursively change all files and directories it contains.

## Files: View SELinux context of a file or directory

The "Edit permissions" dialog now shows a read-only view of the SELinux context.
