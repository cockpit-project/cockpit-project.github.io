Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 263:



## Back and forward browser buttons work as expected

Cockpit used to interfere with browser history. Clicking the back button would frequently get into a loop. Browser history handling is now fixed, so navigating back works as expected.

Additionally, back and forward buttons have been added to [Cockpit Client](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient), the desktop app to connect to Cockpit servers using SSH.
