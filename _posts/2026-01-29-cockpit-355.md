Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 355:


## Add systemd/polkit-based fallback for administrative privileges if sudo is not available

There are systems like [Ubuntu 25.10](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/22811) which don't have `sudo`, or only the [incompatible `sudo-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/issues/1249). Cockpit previously failed to gain administrator rights then. Cockpit 355 now both detects and ignores an incompatible `sudo`, as well as introduces a fallback authentication method: It starts the root bridge through systemd's `StartTransientUnit()` API. This is inspired by systemd's [run0](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/run0.1.html), and uses the exact same underlying mechanism. This is guarded by [polkit](https://polkit.pages.freedesktop.org/polkit/polkit.8.html), so you need to authorize with your user password similar to `sudo`.

## ws: Remove obsolete pam_cockpit_cert module

Cockpit version 209 (Dec 2019) introduced a `pam_cockpit_cert` PAM module in /etc/pam.d/cockpit. Cockpit 248 (Jul 2021) made this module unnecessary, and replaced the module with a stub that did not do anything, plus a warning during package upgrade.

This version finally removes it. So if you have locally modified `/etc/pam.d/cockpit` and still have that module in your configuration, you need to manually remove it.
