Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 155.

### NFS client support

The Storage page now shows currently mounted NFS volumes and offers to
mount/unmount them. Note that this does not yet support Kerberos
authentication; for now this relies on the classic `hosts.allow`/`hosts.deny` ACLs.

See it in action:

### Add "Maintenance" switch for oVirt hosts

Switching a host to maintenance mode causes all VMs to be migrated to another
running oVirt host.

### Fix Terminal rendering issues in Chrome

Console programs like Midnight Commander which use graphical characters
were previously distorted in the Terminal in the Chrome Browser.

### Improve Ctrl+W behaviour in the Terminal

Ctrl+W is commonly being used in a Terminal shell to delete the last word, but
in web browsers it closes the current window or tab. Cockpit now causes a
confirmation dialog to pop up on Ctrl+W when the Terminal is focussed to avoid
accidental closing.

### Support the upcoming OpenShift 3.7 release

When available, use the `rbac.authorization` API instead of the `policybinding`
API for determining project permissions. OpenShift 3.7 now properly supports
the former and stops supporting the latter. Cockpit remains compatible with
older OpenShift releases.
