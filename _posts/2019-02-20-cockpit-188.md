Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly.  Here are the release notes from version 188.

### Machines: Show Storage Volume user

The volume details on the "Storage Pool" page now show which libvirt domains
(virtual machines) use that volume.

### Machines: Autostart configuration

The VM details now have a new check box for enabling or disabling automatic
startup when the host boots.

_Thanks to Simon Kobyda for this feature!_

### Terminal: Themes and context menu

The Terminal can now copy and paste text via the new context menu or by using
key combinations (Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert).

You can now chose between four colour themes: white-on-black (the default),
black-on-white, and light or dark [Solarized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized_(color_scheme)).

### Storage: Responsive dialogs

All dialogs on the Storage page now adjust their layout to small and mobile
browser windows. This is part of an ongoing process to improve layout across
all of Cockpit.

### Software Updates: Show three most recent updates

The Update History was redesigned to show the three most recent updates and a
package count. This design allows other information and features (such as
snapshots) to be integrated in the future.
