Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 153.

### Add oVirt package

This version introduces the "oVirt Machines" page on Fedora for controlling
oVirt virtual machine clusters.  This code was moved into Cockpit as it shares
a lot of code with the existing "Machines" page, which manages virtual machines
through libvirt.

This feature is packaged in cockpit-ovirt and when installed it will replace
the "Machines" page.

### Packaging cleanup

This release fixes a lot of small packaging issues that were spotted by
rpmlint/lintian.
