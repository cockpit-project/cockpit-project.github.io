<p>This feature is deprecated as of Cockpit 322.</p>
</div>
<p>
    Cockpit allows you to access multiple hosts in a single session,
    by establishing SSH connections to other hosts. This is quite
    similar to logging into these other hosts using the
    <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> command on the command line, with one very
    important difference:
  </p>
<p>
    Code from the local host and all the remote hosts run at the same
    time, in the same browser context.  They are not isolated from
    each other in the browser. All code effectively has the same
    privileges as the primary session on the local host.
  </p>
<p>
    Thus, <span class="emphasis"><em>you should only only connect to remote hosts that
    you trust</em></span>. You must be sure that none of the hosts that
    you connect to will cause Cockpit to load malicious JavaScript
    code into your browser.
  </p>
<p>
    Therefore, Cockpit will warn you before connecting to more than
    one host. It is also possible to disable multiple hosts entirely,
    and some operating systems do this already by default.
  </p>
<p>
    You can prevent loading of JavaScript, HTML, etc from more than
    one host by adding this to <code class="filename">cockpit.conf</code>:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    [WebService]
    AllowMultiHost=false
  </pre>
<p>
    When you allow multiple hosts in a single Cockpit session by
    setting <code class="code">AllowMultiHost</code> to true, then the user will be
    warned once per session, before connecting to the second host.  If
    that is still too much, you can switch the warning off completely
    by adding the following to <code class="filename">cockpit.conf</code>:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    [Session]
    WarnBeforeConnecting=false
  </pre>
</div>
<div class="footer"><hr></div>
</body>
</html>
