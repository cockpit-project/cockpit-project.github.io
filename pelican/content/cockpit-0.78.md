### Cockpit Guide

The Cockpit Guide has been updated and includes information about how
various features are implemented, and what sort of privileges they use
on the system.

Here's a link to [the guide](http://files.cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/) or you can take a look at
the [privileges docs](http://files.cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/privileges.html).


### Compatibility with old Cockpit

Recent releases of Cockpit had some compatibility issues when older servers were added to the dashboard, and vice versa. These have been fixed in 0.78


### CPU usage issue

A CPU usage bug in Cockpit 0.77 was fixed.


### From the future
