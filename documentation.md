## Installation

To get Cockpit installed and running on your system, follow the instructions on the [installation and running page](/running.html).

After Cockpit is running, visit **ip-address-of-machine:9090** in your web browser. If your browser is on the same machine where Cockpit is running, then visit [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/) (for example).

## Usage

[The Red Hat Customer Portal product documentation pages](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_9_web_console/index) document how to use the "web console" (another name for Cockpit). While this is specifically for the version of Cockpit that ships in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the interface and its usage is similar on other distributions where the Cockpit web console exists.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 documentation

The documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 is the most up-to-date.
